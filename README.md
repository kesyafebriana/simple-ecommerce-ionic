# Simple e-Commerce Application using Ionic and React

This project is my midterm solo project for the Mobile Cross Platform class. It's a simple e-Commerce application built with Ionic and React.

## Project Description

I was tasked with developing a simple e-Commerce application within a tight deadline of two weeks. The application needed to meet the following requirements:

1. **Add and Remove Products:** Users can add products to their shopping cart and remove them as needed.

2. **Data Fetching from Context:** Product data is fetched and managed using context, ensuring a smooth user experience.

3. **Wishlist Functionality:** Users have the option to add products to their wishlist and remove them as well.

4. **Checkout and Order History:** The application allows users to checkout, and the details of checked-out products are stored in a history page with in-depth history details.

5. **Dark Mode Toggle:** To enhance the user experience, the application features a dark mode toggle.

This project was implemented using Ionic and React, which provide a robust framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

## Features

- Add products to the shopping cart and remove them.
